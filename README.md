# <Unsupervised Wisdom: Explore Medical Narratives on Older Adult Falls>

## Goal of the Competition

Falls among adults 65 and older are the leading cause of injury-related deaths. Medical record narratives are a rich yet under-explored source of potential insights about how, when, and why people fall. Modern machine learning approaches to working with narrative data have the potential to effectively extract insights about older adult falls from narrative medical record data at scale.

**The goal in this challenge was to identify effective methods of using unsupervised machine learning to extract insights about older adult falls from emergency department narratives.** Insights extracted from medical record narratives can potentially inform interventions for reducing falls.
