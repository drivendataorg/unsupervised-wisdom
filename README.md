# <Unsupervised Wisdom: Explore Medical Narratives on Older Adult Falls>

## Goal of the Competition

Falls among adults 65 and older are the leading cause of injury-related deaths. Medical record narratives are a rich yet under-explored source of potential insights about how, when, and why people fall. However, narrative data sources can be difficult to work with, often requiring carefully designed, time-intensive manual coding procedures.

**The goal in this challenge was to identify effective methods of using unsupervised machine learning to extract insights about older adult falls from emergency department narratives.** Insights extracted from medical record narratives can potentially inform interventions for reducing falls.
